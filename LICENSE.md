# Employee Profiling Model

The Employee Profiling Model is an innovative solution utilising machine learning to cluster and profile employees based on various attributes and performance metrics. Harnessing the prowess of `scikit-learn` for clustering, this model aids organisations in understanding their workforce better and making informed decisions.
